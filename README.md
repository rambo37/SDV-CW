# SDV-CW

This repository contains the coursework I completed in the SDV module during my fourth year. It uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) to visualize data on the cost-of-living in London. You can hover your mouse over the lines in the line chart or over the bars in the grouped bar chart to focus on that data.
